# Sourced (POSIX sh, busybox ash, bash): is the VPN's kill switch orphaned - wanted on, with nothing left to enforce it?
# The VPN is a module of its own (github.com/dikeckaan/mu300-linux-vpn) and the images carry no openf50-vpn. A device
# whose VPN is on with its kill switch, and which has lost the module (a reinstall without it, a link that failed,
# the extra removed with --force), would otherwise bring its uplinks up in the clear: mobile-data and wifi-client
# refuse instead (fail closed), and the toolkit and the panel say why. openf50-vpn is not there to ask, so its files are
# read directly, the way it reads them itself - with sed, never sourced:
#   ENABLE       /etc/openf50/vpn.conf, the last ENABLE= line, quotes, blanks and a trailing comment dropped (read_enable)
#   KILL_SWITCH  the store's settings (/etc/openf50/vpn/settings, KEY='VALUE') when the store is in use (a profiles
#                directory and a readable settings file), else vpn.conf's legacy line; only 0 turns it off, so a
#                missing line or a value that is not understood counts as on (openf50-vpn's own default)

# vpn_conf_value FILE KEY: the last KEY= line of FILE, unquoted ('...' or "..."), blanks and a trailing comment dropped
